# QOSF-ScreeningTask1
This repo holds task 1 of the QOSF screening process. It requires the standard scientific libraries
(Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib) and Qiskit

# How to use this repo.
The code that runs the optimization is quantum_task.py once the dependencies are installed it only
requires to be run in the command line. A screenshot
of sample execution is provided in "Execution sample screenshot".png. 
My results from running the code several times for different number of layers and different set ups
of gates can be found in the results folder.
A graph of the evolution of the minimum epsilon over anincreasing number of layers can be found in "Experimental Results".png and the raw data of the evolution
of the target and the correspoding thetas at each step can be found in the results folder. 
The create_graphs.py just holds the code I use to create the plots
